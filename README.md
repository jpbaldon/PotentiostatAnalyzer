**Potentiostat Analyzer** is a cross-platform desktop application that processes and visualizes electrochemical data generated by potentiostats.

It provides:
- **CSV data cleaning** (e.g., removing idle/error periods)
- **Voltage, Current, and Resistance plotting**
- **Tabbed GUI interface** built with PyQt6

---

## Setup and Installation

This project requires Python 3.7+.

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python packages. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## 🔧 Features

- **📁 CSV Import**: Load raw "Squidstat" `.csv` files
- **🧼 Data Cleaning**: Remove non-measurement rows, calculate resistance
- **📈 Plotting**: 
  - Voltage vs Time  
  - Current vs Time  
  - Resistance vs Time
- **🧪 Simulated Data Generation**: Create synthetic test datasets
- **🖥️ GUI**: User-friendly interface using PyQt6 and embedded Matplotlib plots
