## Setup and Installation

The python version of this project requires Python 3.7+.

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python packages. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The C++/Qt (python backend) version does not require Python to be installed. Simply download the Build folder on a Windows machine and run HybridApp.exe.

## 🔧 Features

- **📁 CSV Import**: Load raw "Squidstat" `.csv` files (PyQt version)
- **🧼 Data Cleaning**: Remove non-measurement rows, calculate resistance (PyQt version)
- **📈 Plotting**: 
  - Voltage vs Time  
  - Current vs Time  
  - Resistance vs Time
- **🧪 Simulated Data Generation**: Create synthetic test datasets
- **🖥️ GUI**: User-friendly interface using PyQt6/Qt6 and embedded plots
